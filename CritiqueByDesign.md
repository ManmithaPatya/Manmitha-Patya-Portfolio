# Critique by Design (Data Visualization Exercise 2 and  Critique Assignment 2)
For the completion of this assignment, I followed **five** key steps as listed below. Each step has been elaborated upon in the subsequent sections. 
- [Step one: Find a data visualization with data that can be used](https://manmithapatya.github.io/ManmithaPatya-Portfolio/CritiqueByDesign.html#2.1-Step-one:-Find-a-data-visualization-with-data-that-can-be-used)
- [Step two: Critique the visualization](https://manmithapatya.github.io/ManmithaPatya-Portfolio/CritiqueByDesign.html#2.2-Step-two:-Critique-the-visualization)
- [Step three: Wireframe a solution](https://manmithapatya.github.io/ManmithaPatya-Portfolio/CritiqueByDesign.html#2.3-Step-three:-Wireframe-a-solution)
- [Step four: Test the solution](https://manmithapatya.github.io/ManmithaPatya-Portfolio/CritiqueByDesign.html#2.4-Step-four:-Test-the-solution)

## 2.1 Step one: Find a data visualization with data that can be used
The Visualization I chose for this assignment shows the wage gap between the male and the female genders across twenty industries in the United states. The visualization and the accompanying data can be viewed [here](https://howmuch.net/articles/men-vs-women-comparing-income-by-industry). 
The visualization represents the data as of 2019. However, based on the article, it would be benficial to have either a benchamrk value of comparison or view of historical data so that important trends can be observed. 
## 2.2 Step two: Critique the visualization
## 2.3 Step three: Wireframe a solution
## 2.4 Step four: Test the solution
## 2.5 Step five: Build your solution
