# Final Project: Part I
My final project is centered around the natural world. It's main focus will be animal conservation. The project wil highlight the importance of conservation, the causes of loss of wildlife, the budget allocation by geopraphy for animal conservation and human intervention which negatively affects the natural world. From here, I will talk about the effects of loss of fauna, the most famous extinctions caused by humans mans, a few conservationists. I will conclude the project by suggesting the small steps we can take at a local level to help in preserving the natural world of which these animals are an integral part.

# Method and Medium
The primary platforms that I will use for my project will be serve the following purposes- To build visualizations, To make storyboards, To mind map my vision for the project andto serve an medium for the audience to experince my project.

To build visualizations, my primary platfoorm will be [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/). However, I will switch to tableau should I need more control on how my visualizations look. To make story boards, in addition to hand-drawing a few visualizations, I will make use of platforms like [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). For mindmapping, I will use [Mindmeister](https://www.mindmeister.com/folders), a platform I have been using for ~2 years now. 

And finally, I will use [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/) to tell the story of Wildlife Conservation to the audience.
