# Final Project: Part I
My final project is centered around the natural world. It's main focus will be animal conservation. In addiiton to this, we will also look at the importance of conservation, the cause of loss of wildlife, the budget allocation by geopraphy for animal conservation and human intervention which negatively affects the natural world.


project focuses on the repercussions of the increasing popularity of fast fashion across the globe. The setup of this project highlights how fast fashion has
grown in recent years, owing to more frequent and possibly cheaper availability of apparel. Following this preamble, it would establish a conflict by navigating the 
audience through specific social and environmental issues associated with the adoption of this trend. Finally, it would suggest a possible resolution to the 
identified problem by introducing sustainable fashion trends and corrective action required on part of the consumers.
