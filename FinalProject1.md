# Final Project: Part I
My final project is centered around the natural world. It's main focus will be animal conservation. The project wil highlight the importance of conservation, the causes of loss of wildlife, the budget allocation by geopraphy for animal conservation and human intervention which negatively affects the natural world. From here, I will talk about the effects of loss of fauna, the most famous extinctions caused by humans mans, a few conservationists. I will conclude the project by suggesting the small steps we can take at a local level to help in preserving the natural world of which these animals are an integral part.
