# Final Project: Part II
My final project focuses on wildlife and its conservation. In Part II I will focues on building a naraative that will work as path to take the readers through my story.

# Story Board
For storyboarding, I decided to use [shorthand](https://shorthand.com/). Since my main medium for telling the story of wildlife conservation is Shorthand (as mentioned in Part I), I believe that using the same medium to form a showcase to the interviewees for their feedback will help me obtain more specific responses and comments. 
The link to my storyboard on Shorthand can be found [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/wwCH78d1u4WSKyrD). [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) was used to build visualizations and [canva](https://www.canva.com/) to create infograms.

# User Research

## User Research Protocol
As user research protocol, I will define the following:
- the target audience for my story
- my approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
- my interview script 

Based on this pre-defined protocol, I will provide an overview of the interview findings and explain the changes that will be implemeneted in the final phase of the based on user feedback. 

### Target Audience
Through this project, I hope to strike a chord with those who hope to affect positive change in the environment but havenâ€™t yet gone down that very rewarding path. The learnings from this project will address every individual across the globe and is a call to come together to help conserve the natural world.
With this in mind and with the sole aim of narrowing down the audience pool, I will focus my attention on those individuals who are recent graduates, current students in field of environmental students or those individuals who have worked or are currently working with any environment/ wildlife focued organization. This is because going forward, they will be the change makers. 

### Approach to IDentifying Representative Individuals to Interview
Based on my definition of target audience, I will interview those candidates who fall into each of the buckets of: recent graduate, student in any field of enviromental studies and those individuals who have worked or are currently working with any environment/ wildlife focued organization. 

When choosing an individual who is working in an environment focused organization, I will interview them who have a travelling job. This is because they are the ones who are on-ground and not confined to an office room when making impactful decisions. 

In addition to professional features, I will also consider the following markers when choosing an individual:
- Home Country 
- Age

### Interview Script
I will breakdown the interview questions that I will ask based on certain criteria that I hope to measure through user interviews. My interview questions will be loosely based on previously conducted user interviews for the course and general market research questions. 

The criteria are as follows:
- Emotional Appeal
- Clarity of Visualizations 
- Relatability
- Persuaiveness
- Lacking 
- Overall Aesthetics
- Overall Narrative

| Evaluation Criteria   |  What I Hope to Evaluate | Guiding Questions |             
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Relatability | To evaluate whether the story being presented strikes a chord with the interviewee. This will help me measure if I have chosen the right representative to interview | 1. From the title page, what do you hope to see in this storyboard? <br /> 2. Is topic of interest to you and do you have prior knowlege of it? <br /> 3. What were you surprised to find out? |
Emotional Appeal | To evaluate if the story arc I followed in designing my narrative invokes emotions as I had hoped it would | 4. Are you moved by each piece of information presented to you? <br /> 5. What changes, if any, would have had a bigger emotional impact on you? |
Clarity of Visualizations | To evaluate if I chose visualizations that are easy to follow and if they are perceived as I want them to be | 6. Are the visuals representative of what they are trying to convey or do you think you are being misinformed? <br /> 7. Would you change anything wrt to the visuals that have been presented here? |
Overall Aesthetics | To evalauate the overall visual appeal, tthemes and images that were used. 
Persuaiveness | To evaluate if the story is persuasive and if one can be expected to adopt the call to action when presented with it |
Lacking | To evaluate for the completeness of my story |
Overall Narrative | To obtain details of their final thoughs and recommendations |
