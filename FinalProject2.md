# Final Project: Part II
My final project focuses on wildlife and its conservation. In Part II I will focues on building a naraative that will work as path to take the readers through my story.

# Story Board
For storyboarding, I decided to use [shorthand](https://shorthand.com/). Since my main medium for telling the story of wildlife conservation is Shorthand (as mentioned in Part I), I believe that using the same medium to form a showcase to the interviewees for their feedback will help me obtain more specific responses and comments. 
The link to my storyboard on Shorthand can be found [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/wwCH78d1u4WSKyrD). [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) was used to build visualizations and [canva](https://www.canva.com/) to create infograms.

# User Research

## User Research Protocol
As user research protocol, I will define the following:
- the target audience for my story
- my approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
- my interview script 

Based on this pre-defined protocol, I will provide an overview of the interview findings and explain the changes that will be implemeneted in the final phase of the based on user feedback. 

### Target Audience
Through this project, I hope to strike a chord with those who hope to affect positive change in the environment but havenâ€™t yet gone down that very rewarding path. The learnings from this project will address every individual across the globe and is a call to come together to help conserve the natural world.
With this in mind and with the sole aim of narrowing down the audience pool, I will focus my attention on those individuals who are recent graduates, current students in field of environmental students or those individuals who have worked or are currently working with any environment/ wildlife focued organization. This is because going forward, they will be the change makers. 

### Approach to IDentifying Representative Individuals to Interview
Based on my definition of target audience, I will interview those candidates who fall into each of the buckets of: recent graduate, student in any field of enviromental studies and those individuals who have worked or are currently working with any environment/ wildlife focued organization. 

When choosing an individual who is working in an environment focused organization, I will interview them who have a travelling job. This is because they are the ones who are on-ground and not confined to an office room when making impactful decisions. 

In addition to professional features, I will also consider the following markers when choosing an individual:
- Home Country 
- Age

### Interview Script
I will breakdown the interview questions that I will ask based on certain criteria that I hope to measure through user interviews. My interview questions will be loosely based on previously conducted user interviews for the course and general market research questions. 

The criteria are as follows:
- Emotional Appeal
- Clarity of Visualizations and 
- Relatability
- Persuaiveness
- Lacking 
- Overall Aesthetics
- Overall Narrative
