# Final Project: Part III
## Project Overview
My final project focuses on how the need of humans to separate wildlife from civilization has lead to loss of land and loss of life. This need has caused not only the extinction of various plants and animals but has also made it difficult to protect the existing biodiversity. 

In this part of the project, I will provide an overview of all my work in the previous project submissions and provide a summary of how I navigated through various steps to build the story: **"Humanityâ€™s Destruction of Wildlife"**

### Part I
In Part I of the project, I was very focused on building a narrative centered around wildlife that had a strong story arc and enough publicly available data that could support everything I wanted to explore as a story-teller. I started off with the technique of mindmapping where I first listed out all of the important aspects of wildlife (Both, plants and animals) followed by designing a story arc which covered all those details which I believed were essential to building a hook and a strong call to action. 

Once I had all the particulars in palce, I went ahead with designing visualizations either by hand or on [figma](https://www.figma.com/) which could serve as initial representatives of the story being expressed through data. The development of these sketches all helped me gauge the readability of each of these visuals and formed a baseline upon which I could improve in the next part of the project.
