# Final Project: Part III
## Project Overview
My final project focuses on how the need of humans to separate wildlife from civilization has lead to loss of land and loss of life. This need has caused not only the extinction of various plants and animals but has also made it difficult to protect the existing biodiversity. 

In this part of the project, I will provide an overview of all my work in the previous project submissions and provide a summary of how I naviagted through various steps to build the story: **"Humanity’s Destruction of Wildlife"**

### Part I
In Part I of the project, I was very focused on building a narrative centered aroung wildlife that had a strong story arc and enough publicly available data that could support everything I wanted to explore as a story-teller. 


, for my narrative structure I relied upon the “Setup, Conflict and Resolution” framework discussed in Scott Berinato’s book, Good charts: The HBR Guide. This allowed me to break my story down into three high level components: uncovering the retail trends, conveying their implications, and finally calling upon the audience to act. While drafting the outline, I concomitantly ensured that reliable data sources, which were relevant to my story, were accessible online.

With the summary of the project in shape, I sketched data visualizations to serve as an opening ground for further refinement in the next part of the project. These sketches were helpful in allowing me to gauge the strength of the relationship between my reasoning and the visualizations. In some cases, the visualization did not support the premise of my story, as was the case in my first sketch where a fall in proportional expenditure on clothing was evident. In this scenario, I decided to research further to find data which could possibly justify this, as reflected in sketch 2 of the outline. By the end of part 1, I was equipped with the outline, data sources, sketches and story creation medium, which would serve as essential tools for part 2.
