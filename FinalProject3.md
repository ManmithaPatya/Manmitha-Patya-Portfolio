# Final Project: Part III
My final project focuses on how the need of humans to separate wildlife from civilization has lead to loss of land and loss of life. This need has caused not only the extinction of various plants and animals but has also made it difficult to protect the existing biodiversity. 

In this part of the project, I will provide an overview of all my work in the previous project submissions and provide a summary of how I naviagted through various steps to build the story: "Humanityâ€™s Destruction of Wildlife"
