# Data Visualization Exercise 1: Visualizing Government Debt
## 1. [Web Based Visualization as Generated on the OECD Website](https://data.oecd.org/chart/6B7G)
Here, we look at the plot of General government debt-to-GDP ratio as of the year 2020. This ratio is a measure of gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a measure of the sustainability of a government.

## 2. Visualizations Built on [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/)
Florish is an online data visualization tool which helps create embeddable graphics.

The following is a grid of line type visualization which indicates the Debt-to-GDP Ratio from the year 1995 to 2019
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8534698"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The following visualization is a bubble chart which can be filtered by location and includes a time slider for the year. With this, we can look at the changes in Debt-to-GDP Ratio over years for each individual location.

Hit the play button, choose a location and observe the progression!

Comparing the grid of line type visualization and the bubble chart viusalization,the grid of line type visualization gives us no comparative analysis between countries across the years. It is a static plot. The bubble chart viusalization on the other hand  allows us to filter by country while progressing through various years to track the changes in the Debt-to-GDP Ratio. The insights obtained in each of the visualuzations are different and from a data visualization standpoint focused on insights,the bubble chart viusalization is more effective and provides more insights.
