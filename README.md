# About Me
## Hi There!
I am Manmitha, currently Pursuing Master's in Healthcare Analytics and IT at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. Coming into graduate school with an undegraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering and experience in big pharma, I have always been at the intersection of technology and various aspects of healthcare. While my undergraduate degree served as my first inspiration for the elaborate use of information modelling in healthcare, it was my professional experience which enhanced my view of revolutionizing  healthcare through technology services. During my time at Carnegie Mellon University, I honed skills in Optimization and Process Modelling in addition to various technical skills like Python, R, SQL in order to be an asset to the field of Healthcare Technology.
