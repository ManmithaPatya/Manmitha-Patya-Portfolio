This portfolio serves as a vehicle to share various goals I have reached and various goals I have set for myself during my time at Carnegie Mellon University. The story and goals shared here are specific to my 'Telling Stories with Data' course that I took up in Spring 2022. Here, I had a change to deconstruct and recontruct various visualizations which helped me develop an impoved sense for data visualizations.

## Hi There!
I am Manmitha *(she, her, hers)*, currently pursuing Master's in Healthcare Analytics and IT at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. Coming into graduate school with an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering and experience in big pharma, I have always been at the intersection of technology and various aspects of healthcare. While my undergraduate degree served as my first inspiration for the elaborate use of information modelling in healthcare, it was my professional experience which enhanced my view of revolutionizing healthcare through technology services. During my time at Carnegie Mellon University, I honed skills in Optimization and Process Modelling in addition to various technical skills like Python, R, SQL to be an asset to the field of Healthcare Technology.

# What I hope to learn
As part of this course, I hope to achieve the following:
- to understand the best practices of visualizations which can help me build a story
- to learn how to engage audience with the power of visualization
- to learn to accept, provide and work on constructive criticism of visualizations
- to learn how to add emphasis and deemphasis to various parts of a visualization so that the important aspects shine through
- to improve cosmetics behind the visualizations

# Portfolio
The following is a showcase of the various Visualization Exercises and Projects I undertook during my Telling Stories with Data course.

## [Data Visualization Exercise 1: Visualizing Government Debt](OECD_Visualization.md)
For the visualizations here, I used the datasets available on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website. This website has easy to use publicly availbale data.
This exercise consists of three parts as follows:
- [Web based visualization as generated on the OECD website](https://manmithapatya.github.io/ManmithaPatya-Portfolio/OECD_Visualization.html#web-based-visualization-as-generated-on-the-oecd-website)
- [Visualizations generated on flourish](https://manmithapatya.github.io/ManmithaPatya-Portfolio/OECD_Visualization.html#2-visualizations-built-on-flourish)

## [Critique by Design](CritiqueByDesign.md)
The 'Critique by Design' assignment of this course refers to the **second critique assignment** and the **second data visualization assignment**. 

## [Final Project](FinalProject1.md)
The topic I have chosen for my final project is 'Wildlife Conservation'. Here, I will talk about the importance of wildlife conservation and human intervention which leads to eventual degradation. 
The project will be take place in three phases.

### [Part 1: Project Overview and Initial Sketches](FinalProject1.md)
In the first phase of the project, I will elaborate of the topic I have chosen, I will share mindmaps and an outline of my project. In addition to this, I will also share initial sketches, the data sources and the method and medium for my project. 

### [Part 2: Final Project Wireframes / Storyboards and User Research](FinalProject2.md)
In the second phase of the project, I will use the sketches developed in phase 1 to further develop my story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. I will also conduct user research to form conclusions on what needs to be changes to make the final phase more effective.  

### [Part 3: The final deliverable](FinalProject3.md)
